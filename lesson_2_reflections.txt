What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It starts a commit history on that directory. You need to do it to keep track of your version history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area just shows which files in the working directory you want to go in the next commit to the repository.
Its value is that it allows you to pick specific files to be committed instead of the whole directory.
