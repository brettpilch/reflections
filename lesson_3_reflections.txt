When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with several people or working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes might conflict with something you are working on, so you don't want to update until you are done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy someone else's github repository into your github account. You can't commit changes to theirs.
clone: copy a repository from github onto your computer.
branch: start a different version of the same thing for experimenting or trying new features.
