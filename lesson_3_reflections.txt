When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with several people or working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes might conflict with something you are working on, so you don't want to update until you are done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy someone else's github repository into your github account. You can't commit changes to theirs.
clone: copy a repository from github onto your computer.
branch: start a different version of the same thing for experimenting or trying new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can make changes to the last known state, then push to github and it will merge automatically

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By emailing or dropboxing files back and forth. It might be easier to transfer files, but it
would be much harder to see the changes that were made and maintain different versions.
