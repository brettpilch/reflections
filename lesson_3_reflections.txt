When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with several people or working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes might conflict with something you are working on, so you don't want to update until you are done.
